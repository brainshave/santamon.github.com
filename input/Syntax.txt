Syntax, Fist line = title, second line can be subtitle

attr1: value, simple map
attr2: another value
index: false, don't put in the archives (means this is a page, not a blog post)
tags: obvious, divided by commas
date: 2011-07-18, for now only YYYY-MM-DD format works

After another empty line, first paragraph starts. Like everywhere,
end-of-lines aren't sigficant until ended with two backslashes.\\
Generally, paragraphs are divided by empty lines. Revealing, huh.

* Sections titles are marked by asterisks. (Stealed from org-mode)
One star means h2 tag because h1 is reserved for article title.
By the way, section title is one liner, a paragraph begins immediately after.
(Empty line is optional).

* Lists
There can be bulleted lists. In the input text each list elem starts
 with dash.
- item one
  # asdf
    - uiop
  # qwer
- item two
  - subitem of "item two", identation matters.
    - obvious.
  # obviously there can be numbered lists.
  # they start with hash mark.

* Comments
Lines starting with percentage mark (%) are comments. You won't see this:
% dupa is a beatiful word in my first language.

* Links
Any word ending with .html pointing to existing file
or to an html file that has its *.txt source
or beginning with an http(s):// will treated as a link.
The word immediately before address will be text of the link.
If it's ! then link address will be used.

Tests:
- ! http://pstryk.net/~santamon sdfs  sadf
- /UIOP/ http://ps-tr@yk.net/~sant@amon sdfwefw
- ASDF Syntax.html wefwe
- [qwer uiop] Syntax.html
- @tyuio ghjk tyui@ archive.html
- sd fas Syntax.html! wefwe
- [tyu erty erty wert] http://pstryk.net/asdf/asdf/asdf/#123 wefwe
- QWER http://pstryk.net/~santamon! wfewe we
- /asdf asdfas/ http://google.com/bsd/a/a_a_a

Also, appending ! to the address will make it plain text.

*** Images
All words ending with .png, .jpg, .gif, .bmp (maybe some more) will be
translated to inlined thumbnail pointing to original image, only if
they point to existing file or if they're begining with @http://@ or
@https://@. If ! is added like in asdf.png! , original image will be
inlined.


** Font Styles
- /italic/ between slashes
- _underlines_ between underscores 
- *bolds* between asterisks
- -crosses- between dashes
- @code()@ between monkeys: @
- first, *bolded, then /emphasised/*
- /*-asdf-*/ -*/qwer/*-
- hint: they will only work if there is no space between symbol and a word.
  - *this works*
  - * this won't work*

* Positioning
=> Paragraphs that begins with be right-aligned, right-floated,
with auto width.

<= Analogical to =>.

-> Paragraphs that begins with -> will be right-aligned. -> adsf ->
asdf

| Paragraphs that begins with | will be centered.

* Code and Qutoes
To be thought.

Each line of quote should begin with >, like this:
> Gravity can't be held responsible for people
> falling in love.\\
> /Albert Einstein/

* My Beautiful English
To be learned.
