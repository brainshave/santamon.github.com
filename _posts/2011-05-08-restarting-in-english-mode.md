title: Restarting in English Mode
---

It's time to admit that starting blog about something in it's early
days (like Clojure is) in Polish was a failure. In past (almost) year
I've developed belief that community should keep together tight.
Creating content in Polish doesn't make sense when all Clojurians use
English to exchange their knowledge. It's like intersecting two very
small sets (Polish & Clojure) -- intersection elements count is very
very small.

I probably write creepy English. But I don't care more than I'm
convinced that the more I write the better I write. It's funny (and
you don't have to believe me) that I often think in English (in my
creepy version). It happens usually when I'm swearing and programming
and those two activities usually happen simultaneously ;).

I don't mean that I'll stop to write in Polish (jak na przyk≈Çad
teraz). I'm just inverting proportions and English will be
default. I'll translate some of Polish contents (such as I'll
reintroduce GUI FTW! to the World).

## Dr Jekyll and His Drugs to The Rescue

I've abandoned my [Makeblog](http://github.com/santamon/makeblog)
project and use [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll)
instead. Makeblog worked just fine for me but I just don't have time
to develop it more (I'd rather put these hours to GUI FTW!
project). Jekyll is very well put application. It's elegant, have
server and auto modes (so changes in sources are compiled on the fly),
and what's also important: it integrates with GitHub pages well (so I
keep only sources in my repo). It uses nice
[Liquid](http://www.liquidmarkup.org/) template engine, one of pros is
that you can use it not only in layouts but also in posts.
